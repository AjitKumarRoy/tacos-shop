                        When did tacos first appear in the United States?
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905. Mexican migrants were coming in to
                        work on railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos were
                        essentially a street food at this time since they were highly portable and cheap.
